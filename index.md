# Helis Academy Omics Data Analysis Course 
### January 2021
Ths course is brought to you by the [Helis Academy](https://helisacademy.com/en) and the Department of Bioinformatics - BiGCaT at Maastricht University.

The data used for the tutorials is from the study of [Lu et al. 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20802022) and is freely available for download [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=gse19804). 

The pre-processed data that we will use for the course can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/LaurenDupuis/Helis_Omics_12-13_January_2020/tree/main/Data).


## Introduction to Biological Pathways
For this part of the course you will need to [download](https://pathvisio.github.io/downloads) the pathway drawing software [PathVisio](https://pathvisio.github.io/). Follow the Binary Installation instructions in the [Installation Guide](https://pathvisio.github.io/pages/installation_guide.html) for your operating system.

#### Lectures
* **Introduction to Pathway Modeling** by Dr. Lauren Dupuis (slides prepared by Dr. Kristina Hanspers and Dr. Lauren Dupuis)

#### Tutorials
* You will need to learn how to draw pathways using PathVisio. For extra help you can follow the [WikiPathways Academy](https://wikipathways.github.io/academy/) to get an interactive introduction to pathway drawing.
* You are now ready to get started drawing your own pathways in PathVisio. Before you start drawing or editing pathways, **follow the [Getting Started Guide](https://pathvisio.github.io/tutorials/getting-started.html).** This guide will help you create a [WikiPathways](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/WikiPathways) account, install the [WikiPathways plugin](https://pathvisio.github.io/plugins/wikipathways.html) in PathVisio, and select the proper [BridgeDb](https://bridgedb.github.io/) mapping files.
* Now you are ready to draw some simple pathways of your own. **[Try drawing these pathways](tutorials/Pathway_Drawing.md)**.
